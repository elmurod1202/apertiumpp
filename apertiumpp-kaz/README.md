# apertiumpp-kaz

This repo (`lexicon.rkt` in particular) contains our effort to proofread <a
href="https://github.com/apertium/apertium-kaz/">apertium-kaz</a> against the
15 volume explanatory dictionary of Kazakh (published by <a
href="https://tbi.kz/ru/">tbi.kz</a> and solve issue <a
href="https://github.com/apertium/apertium-kaz/issues/11">#11</a> of
apertium-kaz as well as to extend it.

We plan to merge the results back to apertium-kaz once we're done
proof-reading.
